## üí° Development Notes

- HTML templates live in `/templates`
- Swagger docs generated with [swag](https://github.com/swaggo/swag) (`swag init`)
- Edit connection string or ORM schema as needed for your setup
- Ran into the following issue with [swagger](https://github.com/swaggo/swag/issues/1622), solved by refactoring to use named handlers
- **Tests(Api & Unit)** live in `main_test.go` and cover all endpoints, validation, and error handling while **Integration Test** live in `tests/integration_test.go`
